DistrictBuilder command-line interface
======================================

Note: the majority of this README is auto-generated by running `./node_modules/.bin/oclif-dev readme`.
If there are any changes to the commands/arguments/parameters, run that command to regenerate this file.
The auto-generated README assumes that this CLI will be packaged up and put on NPM. This may be the case
in the future, but until then, commands may be run using `./scripts/manage` rather than using the binary `manage`.
For example, to see help on the `process-geojson`, run: `./scripts/manage process-geojson --help`.

## `manage process-geojson FILE`

process GeoJSON into desired output files

```
USAGE
  $ manage process-geojson FILE

OPTIONS
  -b, --big                            Use this for big GeoJSON files (~1GB+) that need to be streamed

  -d, --demographics=demographics      [default: population,white,black,asian,hispanic,other] Comma-separated census
                                       demographics to select and aggregate

  -l, --levels=levels                  [default: block,blockgroup,county] Comma-separated geolevel hierarchy: smallest
                                       to largest

  -n, --levelMinZoom=levelMinZoom      [default: 8,0,0] Comma-separated minimum zoom level per geolevel, must match # of
                                       levels

  -o, --outputDir=outputDir            [default: ./] Directory to output files

  -s, --simplification=simplification  [default: 0.001] Topojson simplification amount (minWeight)

  -x, --levelMaxZoom=levelMaxZoom      [default: g,g,g] Comma-separated maximum zoom level per geolevel, must match # of
                                       levels

DESCRIPTION
  Note: this can be a very memory-intensive operation,
  depending on the size of the GeoJSON. If you receive
  an error related to memory usage, you can increase
  the Node.js memory limit by setting the following
  environment variable (as large as needed):

  NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=14336"

  Relatedly, set the -b flag for very large GeoJSON files
  that need to be streamed. This is slower, so only use
  it when necessary (file sizes ~1GB+).

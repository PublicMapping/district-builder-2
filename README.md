# DistrictBuilder

This project is a continuation of the original version of DistrictBuilder, now called [DistrictBuilder Classic](https://github.com/PublicMapping/districtbuilder-classic), which is no longer being maintained. This repository is where active development of DistrictBuilder will continue to occur.

**_Note:_ This repository is in the early stages, and is not yet ready for public use. Please don't attempt to set it up yet, since there are several things that need to be ironed out before it can be used by a wider audience. Please contact districtbuilder@azavea.com to sign up for early access and to learn more.**

## Overview

DistrictBuilder is web-based, open source software for collaborative redistricting.

## Requirements

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 17.12+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 1.21+

## Development

Ensure that you have an AWS credential profile for `district-builder` configured on your host system.
The server backend will need this in order to access S3 assets.

Run `scripts/setup` to prepare the development environment:

```bash
$ ./scripts/setup
```

Next, run `scripts/server` to start the application:

```bash
 $ ./scripts/server
```

_Note:_ It is recommended to configure your editor to auto-format your code via Prettier on save.

### Hot Reloading ðŸ”¥

While `server` is running, the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) frontend will automatically [reload](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/#whats-included) when changes are made. Additionally, the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) backend will [restart](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages#nest-start) when changes are made.

### Remote Server Proxy

If you want to develop the `client` locally against a `server` running in the AWS staging environment, you can configure a local proxy using the `BASE_URL` environment variable:

```#bash
BASE_URL=https://app.staging.districtbuilder.org docker-compose up client
```

This will proxy local all requests directed at `/api` to `https://staging.districtbuilder.org`.

### Development Data

To have data to work with, you'll need to do a two step process:

1. Process the GeoJSON for your state/region (this outputs all the static files DistrictBuilder needs to work in a local directory)
1. Publish the resulting files (upload to S3 for use by the app)

To process PA data, first copy the GeoJSON file into the `src/manage/data` directory, create an output directory (eg. `src/manage/data/output-pa`), and then run this command:

```
$ ./scripts/manage process-geojson data/PA.geojson -b -o data/output-pa -n 12,4,4 -x 12,12,12
```

Then:

```
$ ./scripts/manage publish-region data/output-pa US PA Pennsylvania
```

Once your data is published, you should be able to run the app and create a new project through the UI using that region and begin building districts.

If instead you'd like to use the processed data to update S3 in-place (and not insert a new region into the database), you may instead run the command:

```
$ ./scripts/manage update-region data/output-pa s3://previous/location/of/the/published/region
```

Note: when doing this, you will need to restart your server to see the new data, since it's cached on startup

### Project Organization

In order to allow for code-sharing across the frontend and backend in conjunction with an unejected Create React App (CRA), it was decided that the simplest and least error-prone way forward was to structure the code as such:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (Applies to the CRA frontend)
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client (Location for all CRA frontend code)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx (This and another file need to be here for CRA-purposes)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manage (Command-line interface)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (Applies to the command-line interface)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server (NestJS backend code)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (Applies to the NestJS backend)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared (Code that is used by both the frontend and backend)
```

### Stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a declarative view layer
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [redux-loop](https://redux-loop.js.org/) for effect management (eg. API calls)
- [ts.data.json](https://github.com/joanllenas/ts.data.json) for JSON decoding
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for a relational database
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the backend web server
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) for database queries and migrations
- [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) for fast, topologically-aware geospatial operations

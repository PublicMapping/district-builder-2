## Requirements

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 17.12+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 1.21+

## Development

Ensure that you have an AWS credential profile for `district-builder` configured on your host system.
The server backend will need this in order to access S3 assets.

Run `scripts/setup` to prepare the development environment:

 ```bash
 $ ./scripts/setup
 ```

 Next, run `scripts/server` to start the application:

```bash
 $ ./scripts/server
```

 *Note:* It is recommended to configure your editor to auto-format your code via Prettier on save.

### Hot Reloading ðŸ”¥

While `server` is running, the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) frontend will automatically [reload](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/#whats-included) when changes are made. Additionally, the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) backend will [restart](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages#nest-start) when changes are made.

### Project Organization

In order to allow for code-sharing across the frontend and backend in conjunction with an unejected Create React App (CRA), it was decided that the simplest and least error-prone way forward was to structure the code as such:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (Applies to the CRA frontend)
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client (Location for all CRA frontend code)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx (This and another file need to be here for CRA-purposes)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manage (Command-line interface)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (Applies to the command-line interface)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server (NestJS backend code)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (Applies to the NestJS backend)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared (Code that is used by both the frontend and backend)
```

### Stack

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a declarative view layer
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
* [redux-loop](https://redux-loop.js.org/) for effect management (eg. API calls)
* [ts.data.json](https://github.com/joanllenas/ts.data.json) for JSON decoding
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for a relational database
* [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the backend web server
* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) for database queries and migrations
* [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) for fast, topologically-aware geospatial operations
